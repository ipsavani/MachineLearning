# CS-559-MachineLearning

- HW1 : 
  - Linear Algebra.
  - Probability Thory.
  - EDA.
 
- HW2 :
  - Linear Regression Modelling.
  - LDA, Perceptron and Logistic Regression.

- HW3 :
  - Decision Tree and Ensemble Methods :
  - implemented four classifiers - decision tree, random forest, adaboost, and gradient boost from scratch.
  - Evaluate performance by comparing to prebuilt sklearn models.

- Project 1 - Unsupervised Learning Classification
  - built three different classifiers using KMeans, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Logistic Regression on unlabelled data.

- Project 2  - Supervised Learning :
  - A mix of Classification and Regression Model via Gradient Descent(Very mind bending project, had lots of fun doing it.)

- Project 3 - Competetive Handwriting Recognition :
